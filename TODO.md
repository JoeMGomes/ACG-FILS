# Todo

- [ ] Terrain ( Mountain/Hills ) with texture (Maybe 2 or 3 textures based on height/slope?)  
- [ ] Water (river/lake) with waves and appropriate texture
- [ ] Static objects (trees, animals, etc).
- [ ] Dynamic animation (e.g. fish jumping out of the water, a boat / ship 
navigating, day-night cycle etc.) â€“ create the animation in your scene over time OR make it
happen when the user presses some keys

- [ ] Bounding Box Collision
